This is a small project to try out to build a coffee store from some templates and some artist work

 # Inspiration and Resources

The design was inspired from this link on behance [Dellavie â€” coffee packaging and landing page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/42905129/Dellavie-coffee-packaging-and-landing-page).

The structure of the page was inspired from this blueprint [Page Stack Navigation](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/10/21/page-stack-navigation/comment-page-2/#comments) from codrops.

The store gallery was inspired from [Product Quick View](https://codyhouse.co/gem/css-product-quick-view/) from codyhouse.

The Cart system was inspired from [Add To Cart Interaction](https://codyhouse.co/gem/add-to-cart-interaction/) from codyhouse.

This project is still ongoing
